Understood. Below is a refined version of the landing page description and a revised list of images and videos, removing the testimonial element.

### 1. Detailed Landing Page and Value Proposition

The landing page should clearly demonstrate how the **Copilot Inside** turns Microsoft 365 users into power users through adaptive, AI‑guided learning. Key sections and messages:

1. **Hero Section:**

   * **Headline**: “Unlock AI‑Powered Productivity for Every Employee” – instantly conveys the platform’s purpose.
   * **Sub‑headline**: Explain that the course delivers personalized learning paths tailored to each role and skill level, combining videos, hands‑on labs, and real‑time AI feedback.
   * **Primary CTA**: “Start Your Free Trial” prominently displayed.

2. **Core Value Proposition:**

   * **Adaptive Learning**: Content adjusts based on “AI Levels” and “Copilot Levels,” ensuring the right depth of guidance. AI‑powered training videos enhance retention and tailor learning for different styles.
   * **Role‑Specific Experiences**: Dedicated interfaces for learners, managers, and content authors.
   * **Data‑Driven Insights**: Managers get dashboards to monitor progress, engagement, and skill acquisition.
   * **Inclusive & Accessible**: Built with localization (Hebrew/English) and accessibility compliance.

3. **User Journey Explained:**
   Outline the steps — **Onboard** (questionnaire to assess skills), **Learn** (AI‑guided videos, hands‑on labs, and chat simulations), **Achieve** (complete modules and quizzes), and **Grow** (managers assign new content based on analytics). Emphasize that the platform delivers supplementary micro‑videos or explanations when a learner struggles.

4. **Feature Highlights:**

   * **Learners**: Personalized onboarding, multi‑modal content (videos, labs, assessments), progress tracking.
   * **Managers**: Company/department structure management, dashboards for module completion and study commitment.
   * **Content Authors**: Intuitive module editor, variant creation, rich media support.
   * **Technical and Trust**: Modern SPA (Vite + React), secure RBAC, and full accessibility compliance.

5. **Social Proof & Metrics (textual)**:
   Present statistics and logos of organizations using the course to build trust. Since no testimonial video is wanted, rely on metrics and trust badges rather than user quotes.

   Repeat a consistent call‑to‑action after each major section, guiding visitors to start or request a demo.
