## 3. User Accounts and Anonymous Sessions
To access certain features, you may register or log in using our authentication providers (Google, Facebook, Apple, or Email OTP via Supabase).

In addition, when you visit the Site, we may create an anonymous authenticated session/identifier (via Supabase) to support core functionality and to allow the Site to associate your actions with a consistent session. If you later sign up or log in, this session may be linked to your account.

We may record certain interactions (such as which "Start Free Trial" button you clicked, which login method you chose, trial continuation clicks, and which payment method option you selected) for operational, security, and service-improvement purposes.

We reserve the right to verify user affiliation where relevant. While the Site may display payment options or request payment-related information during certain flows, **no charges will be processed without your explicit confirmation**. We use secure third-party services for any payment-related processing where applicable.
