# HandsOnAI Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction
HandsOnAI ("we", "our", or "us") provides the Copilot Inside platform and website (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use the Service.

## 2. Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of information:

### A. Authentication and Account Data (Supabase)
- Unique user identifier (UUID) assigned by Supabase ("user id").
- Email address and login details you provide (e.g., Email OTP), and identity data received from third-party login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple) if you choose those methods.
- Profile information received from providers or provided by you (such as name and avatar URL), and technical metadata related to authentication (e.g., provider name).

**Anonymous sessions:** If you visit the site while not logged in, we may create a Supabase **anonymous** user/session and assign an anonymous user id. If you later sign up or log in, that same user id may be linked to your chosen login method so your pre-signup session can be connected to your account.

### B. Affiliation / Funnel and Usage Data (our database)
To understand the user journey and improve the signup/trial experience, we store certain interaction events and related fields in our database (including in a table used for affiliation/funnel tracking). This may include:
- The URL you visited (e.g., the page where the session started).
- Which "Start Free Trial" button you clicked (stored as a button identifier/number) and the time of the click.
- Which login method button you clicked (e.g., email/google/apple/facebook) and the time of the click.
- When you click the trial continuation button and the time of the click.
- Which payment method option was selected/clicked (e.g., card/paypal/apple) and the time of the click.

These records are linked to your Supabase user id (anonymous or logged-in) and may be updated when you sign up/log in.

### C. Device and Technical Data
We may collect technical information automatically, such as IP address, browser type, device information, approximate location (derived from IP), and logs/events for security and troubleshooting.

### D. Analytics Data (only if you consent)
If you click "Allow All" on our cookie banner, Google Analytics may collect usage and device/technical data to provide aggregated analytics reports.

## 3. Cookies and Similar Technologies
We use cookies and similar technologies as described in our Cookie Policy, including:
- Essential authentication/session storage (including anonymous sessions) via Supabase.
- Local storage may be used to persist your session (so you stay logged in between visits) and to store a first-party identifier to maintain continuity between an anonymous visit and a later login/signup (for example, `session_cookie`). This storage is **strictly necessary** for the operation and security of the Service and is not used for advertising.
- Consent preference storage in local storage (`cookie_consent`).
- Optional analytics technologies (Google Analytics / Google Tag Manager) only with consent.

## 4. How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide and secure access to the Service (including email OTP and social login via Supabase).
- Maintain sessions (including anonymous sessions) and link pre-signup activity to the same session and, if you sign up, to your account.
- Operate and improve the signup/trial/payment journey by analyzing funnel events and user interactions.
- Monitor and protect against fraud, abuse, and security incidents.
- Communicate with you about service updates, security notices, and support requests.

## 5. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)
Where applicable, we rely on:
- **Performance of a contract / providing the Service** (e.g., authentication, session management).
- **Legitimate interests** (e.g., security, preventing abuse, improving the Service).
- **Consent** (for non-essential analytics cookies/tags as controlled via our cookie banner).

## 6. Sharing and Disclosure
We may share information with:
- **Service providers:** Supabase (authentication and data storage), Google (analytics, only if you consent), and accessibility providers (e.g., UserWay).
- **Legal and business needs:** To comply with law, enforce our terms, protect rights/safety, or in connection with a business transaction where permitted.

## 7. Data Retention
We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, including to operate the Service, maintain records, resolve disputes, and comply with legal obligations. We may periodically delete or anonymize data associated with anonymous users who do not complete signup, consistent with operational needs.

## 8. Data Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and secure authentication through Supabase to protect information.

## 9. Your Rights
Subject to applicable law, you may request access, correction, deletion, or export of your personal data, and object to or restrict certain processing. You can manage analytics consent through our cookie banner and your browser settings.

**Data deletion:** If you wish to delete your account and remove your personal information from our records, please contact us at **shir@handsonai.co**. We will process your request and delete your data from our active systems within a reasonable timeframe, subject to any legal or security-related retention requirements.

## 10. International Transfers
Our providers may process data in countries outside your residence. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (such as contractual protections) for international transfers.

## 11. Children
Our Service is not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them.
