# Cookie Policy for HandsOnAI
**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction
HandsOnAI ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our website to (a) ensure the site works properly and securely, and (b) with your consent, to measure and improve website usage. This Cookie Policy explains what these technologies are, how we use them, and the choices available to you.

## 2. What are Cookies and Similar Technologies?
Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website. We also use similar technologies that store or access information on your device, such as localStorage/sessionStorage (together, "cookies and similar technologies"). These technologies are commonly used for site functionality, security, preferences, and analytics.

## 3. How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

### A. Essential & Functional (Strictly Necessary)
These are required to operate the website and core features, including security and user sessions.

#### 1) Supabase Auth (including anonymous sessions)
- **What it does:** We use Supabase to manage authentication and sessions. When you visit the site, we may create and store an authenticated session. If you are not logged in, this may be an **anonymous** session (an anonymous Supabase user/session) so we can maintain continuity and support the free-trial/signup flow.
- **Why we use it:** Session management, security, fraud/abuse prevention, and to maintain continuity so actions taken before signup (for example, clicking "Start Free Trial" or choosing a login method) can be connected to the same session and, if you sign up, to your account.
- **Storage:** We use first-party cookies and/or browser storage (including **localStorage**) to store authentication/session information so you can remain logged in between visits. We may also store a first-party identifier in localStorage (for example, `session_cookie`) to help maintain continuity between an anonymous visit and a later login/signup.

#### 2) Consent preference storage (cookie banner)
- **What it does:** We store your cookie consent choice (e.g., "granted" or "denied") in your browser's local storage (the `cookie_consent` key).
- **Why we use it:** To remember your choice and to ensure optional analytics scripts are only loaded when you consent.

#### 3) Accessibility widget (UserWay)
- **What it does:** We use an accessibility widget to provide accessibility features. It may store settings/preferences on your device.
- **Why we use it:** Accessibility and usability.

### B. Analytics & Performance Cookies (Optional)
These help us understand how visitors use our website so we can improve it. We only load these technologies if you click **"Allow All"** on our cookie banner.

#### 1) Google Analytics (GA4)
- **Provider:** Google LLC
- **Purpose:** Website analytics (e.g., page views, usage patterns, engagement metrics).
- **Notes:** Google Analytics may set cookies and/or use similar identifiers to measure usage. Data is typically reported in aggregated form, but may involve device identifiers and technical information.

#### 2) Google Tag Manager (GTM)
- **Provider:** Google LLC
- **Purpose:** Tag management (GTM loads/controls other tags such as Google Analytics).
- **Notes:** GTM itself may not set cookies, but it can load services (like GA) that do.

## 4. Managing Your Preferences
- **Consent banner:** On your first visit, you can choose "Allow All" (analytics enabled) or "Deny" (analytics disabled).
- **Change later:** You can reset your choice by clearing your browser local storage for this site (including the `cookie_consent` key) or clearing cookies/site data, which will show the banner again on your next visit.
- **Important:** Clearing cookies/site data may also log you out and may reset your anonymous session identifier.

## 5. Third-Party Services
Some services we use (e.g., Google, Supabase, UserWay) may process information for the purposes described above. We encourage you to review their policies for additional details.
